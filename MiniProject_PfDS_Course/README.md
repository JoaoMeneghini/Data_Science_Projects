# MiniProject_PfDS_Course

## This project aims to brace up my knowledge with Data Science till now, involving the basics DS libraries: Numpy, Pandas e Matplotlib.
## My goal is to answer the question "Have the movie genres get better as time passed?".

### For that I will work with the dataset below, in which there are relations with movie titles, its genres and received ratings by different users.

* **Data Source:** MovieLens web site (filename: ml-25m.zip)
* **Location:** [Movies Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
